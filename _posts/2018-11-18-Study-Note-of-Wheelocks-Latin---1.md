This is my study note of Wheelock's Latin (7th edition).

For typing convention, I'll use ~ to indicate a long vowel, e.g. fortu~nam = fortūnam

Bonam fortunam (good luck)

In Latin, the inflection of a verb (verbum) is decided with the following characteristics:

1. Person (perso~na): who performs / receives the action, from the speaker's POV.
2. Number (numerus): how many subjects. Latin has only singular and plural, unlike some other Indo-European languages that have dual (e.g. Sanskrit)
3. Tense (tempus): there are 6 tenses in Latin, they are Present, Future, Imperfect, Perfect, Future Perfect, and Pluperfect (past perfect)
4. Mood (modus - manner): Indicative (直陈式), Imperative (命令式), and Subjunctive (虚拟式)
5. Voice (vox): Active / Passive 

The personal ending is simple:

| Person | Singular  | Plural |
| ------ | --------- | ------ |
| 1st    | -o~ or -m | -mus   |
| 2nd    | -s        | -tis   |
| 3rd    | -t        | -nt    |

### Present Active Infinitive and Present Stem

The **Stem** of a verb indicates the conjugation group that the verb belongs to, e.g.:

* laud**a~re**, **-a~re** indicates that lauda~re as first conjugation
* mon**e~re**, **-e~re** indicates that mone~re as second conjugation

in which, **-a~-** and **-e~-** are both **stem vowel**s.

Dropping the **-re** of an infinitive results in a **present stem**, e.g.:

* lauda~-
* mone~-

and by adding the personal ending to the present stems, we have the verbs in present tense, e.g.:

* lauda~s - (you) praise
* mone~mus - (we) advise

Vowels that are normally long become short in the cases:

* It is followed by another vowel, e.g.: mon**eo~** instead of mon**e~o~**
* Followed by -m, -r, and -t at the end of the word, e.g.: laud**at** instead of laud**a~t**
* Followed by -nt / -nd in any position of the word, e.g.: laud**ant** instead of laud**a~nt**

In first, conjugation, the first person singular ending removes the **-a~-**, e.g.: laud**o~** but not laud**a~o~**.

### Present Active Imperative

This mood is used to give command, and exists only in second person.

The singular is identical to the present stem of a verb, while the plural has a **-t** as suffix.

e.g.: lauda~, lauda~te; mone~, mone~te

### Adverbs (adverbium)

In Latin, an adverb modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb, and it goes before the word it modifies, e.g.:

* No~n valet. (She / He is not well)
* Me~ saepe laudant. (They often praise me)
* Me~ no~n saepe mone~s. (You do not often advise me)
