So, basically, as you may have seen in my recent project: [LICPP](https://github.com/Z-Shang/LICPP),
I'm basically abusing everything I can find on cppreference (lol).

In order to teach myself some **real** C++, I decided to start a series of posts to record my progress
of learning C++ again, 10 years after my first encounter with C++.

The contents will probably be listed below.

P.S.: When I say "C++", I mean the modern subset of C++, and, for sure, C++ 14 and above. (Oh c'mon it
is 2018 now, why should people still use C++ 98 / C++ 03?)
